Garden Station
==============

Single board garden watering controller based on Arduino.

This is a single board AT-MEGA controller.   This has an interface for a display, some LED indicators, inputs for moisture sensors and outputs for servo controller valves.   

Code is now added and the board has now been replaced with an SMD version.  The original prototype board is in the old folder, however there are some wiring issues with the shift registers which require some jumper wire.   This can be seen on the blog page photo.
